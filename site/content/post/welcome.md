My name is Daniel, a semi pot bellied Growth/Digital Marketer and this is the first of many things you will get to read on this blog.

All i want to do, really, is help businesses grow in whatever capacity I can. Trust me, it doesn't have to be via digital marketing. But it is, for now maybe. I just want to see the numbers increase.

I started the blog to organize my thoughts in one place, help other people - digital marketers and businesses - learn (no matter how little) from my own experiences and create a community around all of these.

You will get to read stuff about what I do, and trust me, they can vary. Also, I have a feeling that whatever my interests are has a tendency to evolve overtime. 

So, let's enjoy the ride people.



**Important information**: I pretend to work on my pot belly a lot. Don't judge me.



Your dear Daniel.
